# Guide to Micronaut Kubernetes KeyCloack Sample Project

The goal of this project is to have a reusable project that uses Kubernetes, Micronaut, Keycloak and later Grafana.
A secondary goal is to also create a little bit of documentation that can also be used as a tutorial for other developers.  

If you don't have minikube, java or skaffold installed you can execute the install_depenencies.sh in the scripts folder.  
To apply the kubernetes deployment files you can either deploy the one from the k8s folders one by one or use the k8s_deploy.sh script
